        <h2>The Joker</h2>
        <h3>super hero</h3>
        <p>
          The Joker is a serial killer and a super-villain, a dangerous madman
          who dresses like a clown and commits violent crimes. He is often
          recognized as Batman's greatest enemy, living in and terrorizing
          Gotham City, although he spends most of his time in Arkham Asylum. In
          addition to being a deadly and unpredictable physical combatant, he is
          a brilliant and ruthless criminal mastermind.
